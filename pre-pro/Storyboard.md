#CodeBuffet
##Christmas Card 2013

###Script / storyboard
####By Peter Willemsen

#Start
The cristmas card will be loaded in a static web page, showing a closed CodeBuffet logo in 3D. The logo will be blurred out and a personal message is shown. If no personal message, show a general message.

This message is readable while and before, and after the card has been fully downloaded. Underneath or above the message a loading or play button is showed. When done loading the loading bar becomes a play button.

#Play

##Intro
The user begins with the closed buffet logo from the start, with some decoration like snow and stars and stuff.

The animation starts with the buffet top slowly coming off. On the plate, that by the time the top came off is fully visible, a folded christmas tree is shown. This tree will unfold piece by piece, while zooming in on the unfolding pieces.

##Growing little trees
Each piece that unfolds represents a part of a timeline, showing a project that has been done, a product that has been released or anything else that CodeBuffet has been involved in this year (2013).

#Branding
This year I like to take CodeBuffet to the next level, making the company's christmas card a viral marketing program.

By doing so, in the end of the card we show users a list of recent tweets or facebook messages that were about what they have done in 2013.

##Taking it further
We can allow users to make their own cards out of this card, using their own highlights to show to other users. I dont know if I can make that for this christmas but otherwise it's still a good idea for another year :)
